2005-03-13 15:07:46 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-10

    Summary:
      HPUX support
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-10

    Amazingly not everyone has strsignal() yet.
    
    * strsignal.c: borrowed from gcc libiberty
    * configure.ac: replace strsignal() if missing
    * pty-unix98.c: correct check for I_PUSH
    * with-readline.h: declare strsignal() if missing

    new files:
     strsignal.c

2005-03-13 14:24:46 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-9

    Summary:
      AIX support
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-9

    * configure.ac: Move check for libcurses to the right place
                    AIX doesn't like I_PUSH calls either.
                    Determine PTMX_PATH here (AIX has to be different).

2005-03-13 14:05:08 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-8

    Summary:
      STREAMS support.
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-8

    * configure.ac: Check for libcurses and <stropts.h>
                    Suppress STREAMS ioctls on Linux
    * pty-unix98.c: Push STREAMS modules onto slave pty.  We pass the slave
                    FD back to the caller now, although it currently doesn't
                    do much with it.
    * pty-bsd.c: Pass back slave pty file descriptor.
    * with-readline.c: Typo fix plus changes to support the above.
    * with-readline.h: Include <stropts.h>.

    Summary:
      set-id fixes
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-6

    * with-readline.c: Remember to surrender set-id even when not making a pty
                       Move terminal settings pickup to after surrender

2005-03-12 18:55:17 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-5

    Summary:
      more hassle-free BSD support
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-5

    * configure.ac: choose pty acquisition method here rather than
      with-readline.h.  Also decide whether to make the executable setuid.
    * with-readline.h: no longer decide pty acquisition here.
    * Makefile.am: make installed executable setuid on BSD.

2005-03-12 18:36:33 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-4

    Summary:
      insist that BSD ptys be opened safely
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-4

    * pty-bsd.c: abort if we do not have euid root.  Insanely, openpty()
      ignores chown/chmod failing.

     ChangeLog.d/with-readline--dev--0 pty-bsd.c


2005-03-12 18:25:07 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-3

    Summary:
      BSD pty fixes
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-3

    * with-readline.c: surrender setuid/setgid privilege, for platforms where
      you need to be setuid (or setgid) to safely acquire a pty.  Annoyingly
      you can still unsafely acquire a pty without error on such platforms.

2005-03-12 17:50:41 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-2

    Summary:
      fixes and FreeBSD support
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-2

    * Makefile.am: distribute man page; include getopt*
    * with-readline.h: move readline includes to the end since they break on
      FreeBSD otherwise.

     ChangeLog.d/with-readline--dev--0 Makefile.am with-readline.h


2005-03-12 17:41:30 GMT	Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>	patch-1

    Summary:
      darwin port
    Revision:
      with-readline--dev--0--patch-1

    Now works on Apple Darwin.
    
    * scripts/prepare: Only create config.aux if not exists.
    * configure.ac: Get check for -lutil right way round.
    * with-readline.c: Finish up when we get EOF on pty master
                       Guarantee that pty slave is open before proceeding to
                       event loop.
