with-readline
-------------

with-readline allows readline editing to be applied to an arbitrary
program without recompiling it.

For example:

  with-readline -- sftp HOSTNAME

adds basic line editing to an sftp session.

I test with-readline on Linux and Mac OS X.  Other UNIX platforms
might or might not work (patches invited).

Installation
------------

If you got it from git:
  autoreconf -is
In any case:
  ./configure
  make
  make install

You will need Readline installed.  If it is not in the default search
paths then you must tell configure.  For instance on my Mac:

  ./configure CPPFLAGS='-isystem /sw/include' LDFLAGS='-L/sw/lib'

On BSD systems (including Macs) you must run the installation step as
root, and the program will be installed setuid to root.

If you get errors about rl_gnu_readline_p then you do not have
Readline installed, you have some fake instead.  Install Readline and
try again.

As ever see INSTALL for more information.

Documentation
-------------

After installation, 'man with-readline' should display the man page
for with-readline.
