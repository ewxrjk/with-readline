with-readline
-------------

with-readline allows readline editing to be applied to an arbitrary
program without recompiling it.

For example:

  with-readline -- cat > foo

allows you to write lines to the file 'foo', just as 'cat foo' would,
except that you can edit lines and scroll up and down through history
while doing so.

It is currently a little rudimentary in that it does not cope support
private keymaps, long term history files or any number of other
possibly useful features.

I have tested with-readline on Linux and Mac OS X (Darwin).

Installation
------------

  ./configure
  make
  make install

You will need Readline installed.  If it is not in the default search
paths then you must tell configure.  For instance on my Mac:

  ./configure CPPFLAGS='-isystem /sw/include' LDFLAGS='-L/sw/lib'

As ever see INSTALL for more information.
